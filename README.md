Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is an important measure of glucose control, which is widely applied to measure performance of diabetes care in terms of efficacy of current therapy and to make changes in that therapy. Normal HbA1c level should be lower than 7%, whereas an HbA1c higher than indicates abnormality and thus requires an adjusment in current regimen. A previous study has statistically shown that simply measuring HbA1c is associated with a lower rate of readmission in individuals with a primary diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. In light of this, the current investigation aims to build an artificial neural network for predicting the rate of readmission for a given percentage of HbA1c.
